This code is for the simulation of the models in the paper:
"Multiple modes in tropical tree cover and alternative vegetation states: a multi-dimensional perspective". 

* Model 1: results of the simple monostable model
* Model 2: results of extended Good's model for Case 1 and Case 2 with fixed mortality and its sensitivity analysis
* Data observation: visualization and distribution of the environmental datasets
* Supplementary file: results of extended Good's model for Case 1 and Case 2 with varying mortality
